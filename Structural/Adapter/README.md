# adapter-pattern

Adapter pattern is used when the objects implement a different interface as required by the client.

For example , suppose we modern computers that can only print with modern printers . Now we want add legcay printer support too but modern printers and legacy printers dont impliment same interface . The best way would be to use an adapter so that legacy printers also impliment the interface of modern printers .
