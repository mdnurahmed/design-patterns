# adapter-pattern

Adapter pattern is used when the objects implement a different interface as required by the client.

For example , suppose we got modern computers that can only print with modern printers . Now we want to add legcay printer support too , but modern printers and legacy printers dont impliment same interface . The clean way to solve this problem would be to use an adapter so that legacy printers also impliment the interface of modern printers .
